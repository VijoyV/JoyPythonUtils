### Overview:
This Python script generates a video by synchronizing speech from an MP3 file with Malayalam text subtitles, overlaid on an image. The text is generated using speech-to-text conversion and rendered as subtitles in the video. The script uses several libraries such as `speech_recognition` for speech recognition, `pydub` for audio processing, `moviepy` for video editing, and `PIL` for image processing.

### Code Breakdown:

#### 1. **Configuration and Setup**:
The script begins by setting up logging and loading configuration parameters from a `config.json` file. The configuration includes input/output file paths, audio language, video dimensions, and optional font settings.

- **Logging configuration**: Initializes logging to display the timestamp, log level, and messages.
- **Configuration file**: Loads all required settings, including input MP3, language, image for video, output MP4, subtitle file name, video dimensions, and font.

#### 2. **Audio Conversion and Speech Recognition**:
This step processes the input MP3 audio file and converts it into text using Google Speech Recognition.

- **Audio conversion**: The MP3 file is converted to a WAV format using `pydub` for compatibility with the speech recognition process.
- **Speech recognition**: The Google Speech Recognition API is used to extract text from the WAV file. If the speech recognition process fails, the program logs the error and exits.

#### 3. **Subtitle (.SRT) Generation**:
Using the recognized text, the script creates a subtitle file in the SRT format.

- **Chunking text**: The script divides the recognized text into chunks (each with 10 words) to generate subtitles with timestamps.
- **SRT file**: For each chunk of words, a subtitle entry is created with start and end timings. The timing is calculated based on the duration of the audio.
- **Saving the SRT file**: The subtitle entries are saved to an SRT file with UTF-8 encoding.

#### 4. **Rendering Malayalam Text on Image**:
Malayalam text is overlaid onto the image for each subtitle.

- **Image processing**: Uses `PIL` to draw the subtitle text on the image. The text is broken into lines that fit within the image's width.
- **Positioning**: The text is centered on the image, and adjustments are made to position the text properly.

#### 5. **Image Clip Generation for Each Subtitle**:
For each subtitle, a corresponding image is generated with the text overlay, and these images are used to create video clips.

- **Image clip creation**: Each image (with text) is converted into a video clip using `moviepy`. The duration of each clip is set based on the subtitle timings.
- **Resizing**: The image is resized according to the specified video dimensions.

#### 6. **Final Video Creation**:
The video clips are concatenated and synchronized with the original audio to create the final video.

- **Concatenating clips**: All image clips are concatenated in the order of subtitles.
- **Adding audio**: The original MP3 file is added as background audio to the video.
- **Video export**: The final video is saved as an MP4 file with the specified frame rate and codec.

#### 7. **Logging Process Time**:
At the end, the script calculates and logs the total time taken to complete the entire process.

### Key Functions and Processes:

- **`seconds_to_srt_time()`**: Converts seconds into SubRip time format (used for subtitle timing).
- **`render_text_on_image()`**: Draws multi-line text onto an image and saves it.
- **`concatenate_videoclips()`**: Combines individual image clips into a single video.
- **`recognizer.recognize_google()`**: Uses Googleâ€™s speech recognition API to convert audio into text.

### Libraries and Dependencies:

- **`speech_recognition`**: Used for converting speech from the audio file into text.
- **`pydub`**: For audio processing and conversion between formats (e.g., MP3 to WAV).
- **`moviepy`**: To create video clips from images and synchronize them with audio.
- **`PIL` (Pillow)**: For image processing, including rendering text on images.
- **`pysrt`**: To generate and handle SRT subtitle files.

### Configuration (`config.json`):
This file contains all the parameters required to run the script. Example:

```json
{
  "input_mp3": "./input/Swargasthanaya.mp3",
  "audio_language": "ml-IN",
  "image_for_video": "Rosary.png",
  "srt_filename": "./output/Swargasthanaya.srt",
  "output_mp4": "./output/Swargasthanaya.mp4",
  "font_path": "C:\\ExtraFonts\\keraleeyam.ttf",
  "video_dimensions": [1080, 1920]
}

```

### Usage:
1. Provide the necessary input files and configuration in `config.json`.
2. Run the script to generate the video with synchronized Malayalam subtitles.
